		<p class = "stratPgPar"> Wolfey's team is at first glance extrememly unconventional for a doubles tournament (meaning 2 Pokémon on on the feild at once). However, there
			is some extrememly niche and tricky strategy with this team.

				<th> 
					<p class = "stratPgPar"> Perish Song is a normal, non-damaging move. When used, all the Pokémon get a count down starting at 3. This represents the turns
						at which the Pokémon takes to faint. Every turn the count decreases by 1 and once it gets to 0 the Pokémon faints. However, this can be easily dealt with
						by simply switching out to another Pokémon.
						<br>
						<br>
						However, Wolfey has another trick up his sleeve.

					<p class = "stratPgPar"> Shadow Tag is a ability that forces the opponents to stay in the battle. This means they can not switch out unless a
						move such a volt switch, a move that forces the user to switch, is used.
						<br>
						<br>
						You may notice every team member on Wolfey's team has protect. This is used to stall out 1 out of the 3 turns of Perish Song. Gothitelle's Shadow Tag
						keeps the opponents in. His entire team's movest, held items, abilities, and stat spread are made for one purpose: to stall out the Perish Song turns and to
						safely switch out so they themselves don't faint.
						<br>
						<br>
						Both Flutter-Mane and Screaming-Tail have perish song, so if need be they can switch into each other for the final Perish Song turn. This can also be used
						as back-up in case any of the 2 faint. Arcanine and Palafin are Pokémon with switching based abilities, Arcanine with intimidate and Palafin with Zero to Hero.
						If they swap they can apply stat drops and make it easier to stall out the turns.

		<p class = "stratPgPar">Both his support Pokémon and his main gimmicks are what makes his team so good. Every Pokémon synergizes with each other for any situation. Not only
			this, but he managed to popularize the use of Scream-Tail, a Pokémon thought to be extremely weak. It just goes to show that no matter what you use, if you have a good
			strategy anything can happen.
