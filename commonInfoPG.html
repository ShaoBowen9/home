		<h1 class = "cInfoHeading"> The Basics </h1>
		<p class = "cInfoPar">To get good at Competitive Pokémon, it is important to understand the basics. To begin, it is good to get familiar with the type matchups. Here
		is a chart of the effects each typing has on each other, also known as the type match-up chart.
		</p>
		<iframe src = "https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/types/" id = "typechart"></iframe>
		<h5>Type chart made by smogon</h5>
		
		<p class = "cInfoPar"> Each row represents how much a type will do against another. Each column represents if a type is weak or resistant to another. The numbers (1x, 1/2x,
			2x) represent the damage multiplied depending on if a type is strong, weak, or neutral against another type. Understanding the type matchups can help you pick out a team,
			severely increasing the damage your team is dealing to the opponents as well as maintaining a good defense.
		</p>
		
		<h1 class = "cInfoHeading"> For example... </h1>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th> <img src = "imgs/cInfoImgs/teamBuildingWithTypes.png" alt = "Team Building Example"> </th>
				<th> 
					<p class = "cInfoPar"> Skuntank is a poison and dark type. Looking at the type match-up chart, the weaknesses and resistances of dark and poison make it so
						it doesn't have any weaknesses <i>except</i> ground. This way, we can put a water type such as Rotom-Wash on our team to take care of any ground types as
						ground is weak to water (and Rotom-Wash has levitate, making it immune to ground moves).
					</p>

		</table>
		
		<h1 class = "cInfoHeading">Abilities</h1>
		<p class = "cInfoPar"> Abilites are just as vital as movesets. If you didn't know already, abilities are passive effects each Pokémon has. They each have specific Pokémon
			that can get the ability. Most abilities can be obtained by multiple Pokémon, but some Pokémon have a <b>signature</b> ability. For example... 
		</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th> 
					<p class = "cInfoParLeft"> Here we can see Shedinja has the ability "Wonder Guard". This ability is signature to Shedinja, meaning no other Pokémon can get this
						ability. If you don't know what an ability does <a href = "https://www.serebii.net/abilitydex/"> you can click here</a> to go to serebii's AbilityDex and
						search up what the ability does. In this example, Wonder Guard allows Shedinja to ignore all damaging moves unless they're super-effective. Looking on the
						type chart, we can see the only moves that effect Shedinja are moves that are Dark, Flying, Rock, Fire, or Ghost.

		<h1 class = "cInfoHeading"> Base Stats, EVs, IVs, and Nature </h1>
		<p class = "cInfoPar"> Though intimidating, Base Stats, EVs, IVs and nature are important subjects in competitive Pokémon. This information will come in handy in team building 
			and deciding roles each of your team members play. </p>
		
		<h1 class = "cInfoHeading"> Base Stats </h1>
		<img id = "baseStats" src = "imgs/cInfoImgs/baseStats.png" alt = "Base Stat Example">
		
		<p class = "cInfoPar"> The most simple is base stats. Each Pokémon has 6 main stats. These stats are Hit Points or Health (HP), Attack (Atk), Defense (Def), 
		Special Attack (SpA), Special Defense (SpD), and Speed (Spe). Each species of Pokémon has their own unique value of each category, for example Pikachu has a base speed stat 
		of 90. 
		<br>
		<br>
		For reference, this is a table of what each stat does as well as the Pokémon with the highest and lowest stat of that category. However, it is important to note that 
		different games (called generations) may have different casts of Pokémon, and the rankings may change. If you want to include any of these Pokémon, check to see if the 
		generation you’re playing in supports it.

			</tr>

				<td>Defense (Def)</td>

				<td>Health (HP)</td>

				<td>Blissey and Chansey with a base health of 255. This makes up for its horrendous attack and defense stats of 10, but still makes it a monster to deal with.</td>
				<td>Shedinja with a base hp of 1. That’s right. It has 1 hit point, but it also has a gimmick ability Wonder Guard which makes it immune to all damaging moves unless it’s super-effective. Neat! </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Speed (Spe))</td>
				<td>Determines the order in which the turns play out.</td>
				<td>Regieleki with a base speed of 200. This newly introduced legendary is insanely fast, almost outspeeding any Pokémon without stat changes.</td>

			</tr>

				<td>Base Stat Total</td>
				<td>The sum of the base stats of the Pokémon, including every category.</td>

					When you catch a Pokémon, they get a random set of permanent values for each of the 6 stats. They are a meticulous subject and usually count on luck to get good IVs.
					However, if you're using Pokémon Showdown you wouldn't need to worry about IVs as they're always set to max.

					<p class = "cInfoPar"> Much like IVS, EVs are also hidden numbers. However, unlike IVs, they can be changed. They stand for Effort Values, and they can be complicated to earn. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Your Pokémon can earn 512 EVs in total. Defeating a species of Pokémon gives a specific stat for EVs, for example Ponyta gives 1 speed EV. Each stat can get
						254 EVs in total, but you can spread the 512 you can earn with each category of stat.
						<br>
						<br>
						Actually earning these EVs is a different story, you must spend hours to defeat a specific type of Pokémon and make sure you don’t defeat any other Pokémon 
						otherwise your spread wouldn't be right. However, I suggest using Pokémon Showdown. Instead of slowly grinding for these EVs and IVs you can move a slider 
						up and instantly get max EVs of your choosing.
