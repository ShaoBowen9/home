						This is usually where all the legendaries are held, all the insane Pokémon with overly high stats. For example: Rayquaza. It wouldn’t be considered fair if

						<br>
						However, you can play other tiers against Uber, so for whatever reason if you want to play Sunflora against Ubers you can. It’s just you can’t play with

						OU is considered the standard tier or the meta (meta means what the others commonly tell you to play). Most of the strong Pokémon used in competitive games 
						are in OU, and you should get familiar with OU Pokémon. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Most pseudo-legends are OU. In short, pseudo-legends are normal Pokémon with the stats of legendaries. For example, Tyranitar is a pseudo-legend as it has 
						very good stats and an excellent ability (sandstorm) but is not a legendary.
						<br>
						<br>
						It is here that most commonly known strategies are made as these Pokémon are so popular, so if you want premade strategies it is best to play in OU.

					<p class = "compTierPar">
						Underused Pokémon are Pokémon wouldn’t be typically use in your team unless it has a specific purpose or it synergizes well. These Pokémon commonly have not 
						the greatest stats, but they can be very strong if used correctly.
						<br>
						<br>
						An example of a good UU Pokémon would be Amoongus. Though it has lackluster attack and special attack, it has a half decent defense. It also pairs well with 
						the held-item black sludge, which heals only poison types, and the move toxic which does chip damage over time. It makes it a good status effect inflicter 
						and a good staller, even though it’s UU.

				<td>
					<p class = "compTierPar">
						RU Pokémon are similar to UU in that unless they have a specific function in a team, they’re the equivalent of rocks. A lot of good Pokémon in the RU tier 
						are gimmicky and have a high risk high reward type of gameplay.
						<br>
						<br>
						An example of this, would be Cloyster. The reason why it’s RU is because it’s really easy to counter with its overall stats being on the lower side. However,
						it can be used in a gimmicky way in which you give it skill link and shell smash. If you manage to pull this off it’s almost an instant win, but it can be 
						countered easily if not smartly used.

					<p class = "compTierPar">
						Never used Pokémon are hardy used at all. Their stats and move sets are so low they simply aren’t picked by most players. A handful of them can be 
						useful, but they’re really gimmicky and have a low chance of success.
						<br>
						<br>
						An example of a NU Pokémon is Pangoro. It’s good, but it can’t compare to better Pokémon like Tyranitar. However, if you use them right you might find
						a way to give NU Pokémon a role on your team.

					<p class = "compTierPar">
						PU tier is a pun where the tier is compared to the exclamation "pee yew", saying how bad the tier is. This tier is where all Pokémon that aren't any
						of the other ranks go. Most commonly, you wouldn't see anyone playing any Pokémon from this tier if they're intending to win.
						<br>
						<br>
						An example of this would be Hitmonlee. Hitmonlee can hardly hold it's own in a battle and being a pure fighting type means it barely has any synergy with any 
						teammates. It's stats can be easily matched, if not completely outmatched by way more flexible options such as Hawlucha.

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p class = "compTierPar">
						AG stands for Anything Goes, which pretty much means the Pokémon is banned anywhere except for competitive scenes without any restrictions. This can be due 
						to the fact that they have too strong of stats and moves, or they have abilities that are just too broken for competitive Pokémon. To make it fair, these
						Pokémon aren’t allowed to compete in tournaments or normal gameplay in general. 
						<br>
						<br>
						An example of this would be Mega-Rayquaza. Not to be confused with Rayquaza, Mega-Rayquaza, being a mega legendary, is insanely game breaking as its base 
						stats are one of the highest in the game. This makes it nearly impossible to deal with before getting the majority of your team wiped. This is why it’s 
						banned in most competitive scenes.
						<br>
						<br>
						This being said, there are AG modes so if you ever wanted to play banned Pokémon you can play in the Anything Goes tier.
